# Sensor_Placement


The Matlab Code is used in the paper: 
    
    <Sensor placement by maximal projection on minimum eigenspace for linear inverse problems, IEEE-TSP, 2016>


All the code have been tested using MATLAB 7.8.0 (2009a)



Before using the code, please make sure that you have installed the SDPT3‐4.0 solver and CVX toolbox.


1. The CovnexOpt.m requires the SDPT3‐4.0.
    
        The users can freely download the SDPT3‐4.0 solver from: www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc//sdpt3.html
        
        Every time before using the code, do the following two steps to start up the SDPT3‐4.0 solver:
        
                Step one: run Installmex
            
                Step two: run startup (run both in command window)
        
        For more detail about the SDPT3‐4.0, please visit: www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc//sdpt3.html


2. The SparSenSe_CVX.m requires the CVX toolbox.

        To acquire the CVX toolbox, please Visit: http://cvxr.com/cvx/
